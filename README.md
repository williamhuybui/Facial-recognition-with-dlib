Project status: Completed

# Description
In this project. I will introduced a new way to detect faces as well as different implementation to 
increase the accuracy of the result

# What I have done
Given a limited resource of pictures library, I try to increase its accuracy in detecting face features. 
The purpose of it is to create a magic class that can recognize my friends face and tell me their name.

# What left to be done
Data augmentation by rotating, shifting, fliping, adding noises to the face
